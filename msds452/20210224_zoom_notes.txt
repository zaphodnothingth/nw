we have the citation graph of a database or some topic
derive cocitations and bibliographic coupling
using abstracts, with sources and titles in graph
we need abstracts for all sources & refs
have topics as attributes of nodes
if we have a directed path in a chain of citations
    is this path also represented in the coupling or cocitation graph
    if we can go from i to i+1, then we can form triangles of ij
        the other 2 edges are formed by vertex that are both pointing to ij - making ij a cocitation with weighting as num of references
        when 2 articles cite 1 ref - bibliographic coupling (both point at k; i & j don't reciprocate
        
        
    if nodes of a topic are citing nodes of the same topic
    
    if we can aggreagate tpics
    topic a is connected to b if topic a nodes cite topic bibliographic
        aggregate to weight them by the number of citations
        extract semantic info through topic modeling
        
    see if you can extract citations\\
    
    sandy would like to have socio epistomology
    
    for the last homework, you've already done the networks
    for the course project you can just include what you've already done
    present the neo4j viz
    you have to write a report
