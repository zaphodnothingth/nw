AB Livestock movements create complex dynamic interactions among premises
   that can be represented, interpreted, and used for epidemiological
   purposes. These movements are a very important part of the production
   chain but may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases
   through the transfer of infected animals over large distances. Social
   network analysis (SNA) can be used to characterize cattle trade patterns
   and to identify highly connected premises that may act as hubs in the
   movement network, which could be subjected to targeted control measures
   in order to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases such as
   bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here, we analyzed data on cattle movement and
   slaughterhouse surveillance for detection of TB-like lesions (TLL) over
   the 2016-2018 period in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil
   with the following aims: (i) to characterize cattle trade describing the
   static full, yearly, and monthly snapshots of the network contact trade,
   (ii) to identify clusters in the space and contact networks of premises
   from which animals with TLL originated, and (iii) to evaluate the
   potential of targeted control actions to decrease TB spread in the
   cattle population of RS using a stochastic metapopulation disease
   transmission model that simulated within-farm and between-farm disease
   spread. We found heterogeneous densities of premises and animals in the
   study area. The analysis of the contact network revealed a highly
   connected (~94%) trade network, with strong temporal trends, especially
   for May and November. The TLL cases were significantly clustered in
   space and in the contact network, suggesting the potential for both
   local (e.g., fence-to-fence) and movement-mediated TB transmission.
   According to the disease spread model, removing the top 7% connected
   farms based on degree and betweenness could reduce the total number of
   infected farms over three years by >50%. In conclusion, the
   characterization of the cattle network suggests that highly connected
   farms may play a role in TB dissemination, although being close to
   infected farms was also identified as a risk factor for having animals
   with TLL. Surveillance and control actions based on degree and
   betweenness could be useful to break the transmission cycle between
   premises in RS.
