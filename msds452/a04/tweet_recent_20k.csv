1209089047760535552,BradMunchen,1577104267,"2) $TSLA only has 29 SCs in China (408 globally), which by 2019 end should equate to 3.1K Teslas/SC in China (40% > global avg).

1209089049190756353,BradMunchen,1577104267,"3) My estimate of $230m is conservative, assuming that only 1/2 of the additions are made in the 3 main cities (probably a higher % needed, as they have more wealthy $TSLA owners).

1210967030339387399,,1577552013,"4/ The Model Y has been billed as being capable of adding a third row of two additional seats. However, the vehicle as shown at its unveiling, as well as in various sightings in the wild, doesn't look capable of fitting such seats effectively. $TSLA $TSLAQ",1,0,0
1210967031765458945,,1577552013,"5/ Much like the optional third-row jump-seats available for the Model X, the Model Y’s third row appears likely to be suited only to children and small passengers. In other words, it is not a true 7-passenger vehicle as advertised. $TSLA $TSLAQ",1,0,3
